# Microshop

Microshop is a web application built using React, providing a platform for people to buy products via e-commerce. Our goal is to offer a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for users.

## Upcoming Enhancements
```sh
Microservice Architecture
   Scalability: Improved performance by breaking down the application into smaller services.
   Maintainability: Easier updates and faster development cycles.
   Reliability: Fault isolation to ensure issues in one service donâ€™t affect the entire application.
Docker Integration
   Consistency: Ensures the application runs the same across different environments.
   Simplified Deployment: Easier to manage and scale the application.
   Efficiency: Lightweight containers improve resource usage and performance.
